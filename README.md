## Introduction

Hello, my name is Jake, welcome to my blog!&#x20;

Since graduating high school, I've been very fascinated with the IT world in its entirety. I have been studying IT and mostly any aspect of it I come across. I enjoy leaning everything I can and am safely able to say I have become a black hole for information. I started this blog because I decided that it would be a good idea to document all of my projects and what I have been doing throughout my time in school. Of course, I plan to expand it when I graduate and as I complete more projects.

Typically, I work on projects whenever I get time in between classes, and always aim to learn at least one thing new a day. At the time of writing this, 5/30, today I learned about the vulnerabilities and risks of using JSON Web Tokens and how they are exploited in the wild.

Currently, these are the things I am working on and areas I am increasing my knowledge in

* Electronics hardware (through my auto-cat-feeder project)
* CTF challenges
* Computer Networking
* Human Psychology (Reading "Talking to Strangers", "Keeping the Score", and "The Wisdom in Psychopaths"
* Programming (python and micropython currently)

As I learn new things, I will update the page of books I have read, programming languages I have used and gotten some experience with, along with what CTF's I have participated in and my scores. My hope is that through this blog, my working knowledge of these subjects increase each day and open up further opportunities to fill in any gaps in knowledge I have.
